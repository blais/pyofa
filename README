Description
===========

pyofa is a simple Python wrapper around the MusicDNS technology
provided by MusicIP for generating PUIDs (audio fingerprints) from
audio files (e.g. MP3, M4A, etc.).

- MusicIP's `libofa <http://www.musicip.com/dns>`_

You will need your own MusicDNS key to use this package. You simply
provide it to the `getpuid()` function. You register for a key here:

.. note::

   Lukáš is the author of the great majority of the code, I just
   repackaged and simplified it outside of Picard because I wanted to
   write scripts using MusicDNS without a GUI application.
